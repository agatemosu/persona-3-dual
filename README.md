# Persona 3 Dual

A Nintendo DS demake of **Persona 3**, developed in C++ using devkitpro. This project is a personal deep-dive into embedded systems and low-level graphics programming, building a game engine from scratch without external game libraries.

This project began as a way to explore more embedded programming in a fun way. I always wanted to make a game, so I thought why not use embedded to make a game? I decided on developing a game for the Nintendo DS as it was my first ever game console, and I grew up with it. It is a portable, sleek, and popular game console with a large homebrew and hacking community and supports basic 3D, which is what I wanted. Plus, it has some unique hardware like dual screens, a touch screen, and microphone to use if I ever want to (which I plan to!).

I chose to make a demake of one of my favourite games, Persona 3, for a few reasons. I really enjoyed the game and there wasn't an official DS version (or any custom version for the DS that I found). Also, Persona has a lot of 2D graphics which would make game development easier in my opinion. And I'm not awefully creative, so basing my game on a pre-existing game would allow me to really focus on coding while also giving me a good story, basic gameplay mechanics, and assets to use and base my own custom assets off of.

Later on (around April 2026), I found out that there was an online joke about having a DS version of Persona 3 called "Persona 3 Dual". I ended up renaming my project from "Persona 3 DS" to "Persona 3 Dual" as a fun nod to this joke (and to make it into reality!)

> **Status:** Active development: basic intro sequence and main menu complete, 3D environment (Iwatodai Dorm) in progress.

## Features

- **Animated Intro & Main Menu** — Multi-layer 2D compositing with sinusoidal sprite/background animations, fade effects, and a custom logo split across two stitched sprites. The sub-screen has a static layer plus an animated attributions layer. "Press Start" animates independently of screen brightness.
- **State Machine Architecture** — View-based state machine with clean scene separation (Disclaimers → Intro → Main Menu → Iwatodai Dorm). Each scene has its own `.cpp`/`.h` pair with dedicated init and cleanup functions.
- **2D Graphics Pipeline** — Manual VRAM bank allocation supporting 4 simultaneous background layers with extended palette support. VRAM placement is calculated via tile-count analysis to prevent memory corruption.
- **3D Environment** — Fixed-function 3D rendering with display list geometry, UV-mapped textures, and free camera controls (rotate + translate). The camera orbits and follows the player, updating movement direction relative to facing angle.
- **Collision & Interaction System** — Tile-based 2D collision map overlaid on the 3D world. Zones are typed (wall, save point, scene transition, NPC trigger) to drive interactivity like zone loading and character encounters.
- **Dialogue Controller** — Fully-featured dialogue system with character-by-character text animation, per-line character portraits, branching dialogue trees with d-pad navigation, scrollable history, and automatic word-wrapping. Dialogue is authored in plain Markdown and converted to header files via a custom generator.
- **Decoupled Controller Architecture** — Character movement, camera, dialogue, music, and video are each in separate controller files, making the codebase modular and easy to extend.
- **Audio** — PCM audio streaming via NitroFS with loop point support for seamless section looping. Also supports SFX via Maxmod.
- **Video** — Optimised video playback at 8-bit colour, 15fps, with audio and video frames interleaved in a single file and streamed via a ring buffer. Uses NitroFS.
- **Custom Tooling** — Python utilities built alongside the engine: `obj2bin.py` converts Wavefront OBJ files (with UV data) to DS display list binaries; a Blockbench texture → header file converter; a Markdown → dialogue header generator with automatic line-breaking; and a world offset calculator. Asset conversion is integrated into the build system via `make`.
- **Hand-modelled Assets** — 10+ low-poly environment models built in Blockbench: receptionist desk, dining table, chairs (2 variants), wardrobe, side table, lamps, TV, and doors.

Key changes made (v0.2):
- **State Machine** — added Disclaimers as the first scene
- **Dialogue Controller** — added auto word-wrapping and Markdown sourcing
- **Audio** — updated from mp3/libmad to PCM streaming with loop points and Maxmod SFX
- **Video** — replaced the old frame-streaming description with the optimised interleaved ring-buffer approach
- **Custom Tooling** — added the Markdown dialogue generator, world offset calculator, and build system integration; also cleaned up the `obj2bin.py` link formatting
