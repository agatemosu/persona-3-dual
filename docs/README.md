## Running the Game

The game requires FAT filesystem support to load assets at runtime. Currently, we only support:

- **[melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php)** (multiplatform emulator)
- **Real DS / DSi / 3DS hardware** via [TWiLight Menu++](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/)

> NOTE: Other flashcard launchers may work, but are untested

### melonDS (Emulator)

1. Download `persona-3-dual.nds` and `sdcard.img.gz` from the latest release, & decompress `sdcard.img.gz`
**Developers**: Build the project with `make` - this produces both `persona-3-dual.nds` and `sdcard.img`.
2. In melonDS, go to **Settings → DLDI** and enable DLDI.
3. Set the SD card image path to the generated `sdcard.img`.
> **Do NOT enable "Sync SD card to folder"**. This will wipe the contents of the folder.

Now, you can open melonDS and load the `persona-3-dual.nds` ROM!

### Real Hardware (DS / DSi / 3DS)

Requires [TWiLight Menu++](https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/) with DLDI patching enabled.

1. Download `persona-3-dual.nds` and `data.zip` from the latest release, & decompress `data.zip`
**Developers**: Build the project with `make` - this produces the `persona-3-dual.nds` and the content in `/data`.
2. In TWiLight Menu++ settings, ensure **DLDI access** is set to **ARM9** & the **Game Loader** is set to **nds-bootstrap**
3. On your SD card, navigate to your `/roms/nds/` folder (or equivalent).
4. Copy `persona-3-dual.nds` and the entire `/data` folder into that directory:
   ```
   /roms/nds/
   ├── persona-3-dual.nds
   └── data/
       ├── music/
       ├── video/
       └── ...
   ```
5. Launch the game through TWiLight Menu++ as normal.

## Developer Setup

The team has opted to use **Docker** as the official dev solution, as it wraps the entire toolchain into a single image so you get an identical build environment regardless of your OS.

### 1. Install Docker

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Windows / macOS | [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |
| Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) | [See Docker's Website for your Distro](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/) |

Verify the install:
```
docker --version
```

### 2. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p3d-project/persona-3-dual.git
cd persona-3-dual
```

### 3. Set Up Code Formatting Hooks

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and register the hooks once:

```bash
# macOS
brew install pre-commit

# Windows / Linux
pip install pre-commit
```

```bash
pre-commit install
```

The hooks run automatically on every `git commit` and keep C/C++, Python, and web files consistently formatted. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

### 4. Build the Docker Image

Run this **once** (or again whenever `Dockerfile` or `tools/requirements.txt` changes). It downloads and caches all dependencies:

```bash
docker build -t p3d-dev .
```

> First build takes a few minutes while devkitARM downloads. Subsequent builds use the Docker layer cache and much quicker.

### 5. Compile the ROM

```bash
# Linux / macOS
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/project p3d-dev make

# Windows (Command Prompt)
docker run --rm -v "%cd%":/project p3d-dev make

# Windows (PowerShell)
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/project" p3d-dev make
```

This produces `persona-3-dual.nds` and `sdcard.img` in your repo folder!

### 6. Interactive Shell (optional)

If you want to poke around, run commands manually, or debug the build:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/project p3d-dev

# Windows PowerShell
docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}:/project" p3d-dev
```

You're now inside the container at `/project` (your repo). Type `exit` to leave.

### Useful Docker Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `docker build -t p3d-dev .` | (Re)build the dev image |
| `docker images` | List images on your machine |
| `docker rmi p3d-dev` | Delete the image (frees disk space) |
| `docker ps` | List running containers |

## Roadmap

See the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/p3d-project/projects/1) for current progress and open issues.

### ✅ Major Completed Features

- [x] Basic intro sequence
- [x] 3D environment rendering with UV-mapped textures
- [x] Character model + movement controls + animation
- [x] Music/SFX playback (PCM streaming via FAT, loop points, Maxmod SFX)
- [x] Video playback (8-bit, 15fps, interleaved audio+video, ring buffer)
- [x] Custom intro video (Persona 3 Dual logo) + classic intros (P3, P3 FES, P3P)
- [x] Automated asset conversion pipeline and tooling (integrated into `make`)
- [x] Dialogue system with branching and portraits
- [x] Basic battle system
- [x] Basic collision/mapping system
- [x] Basic menu system
- [x] Basic HUD with sprites
- [x] Basic battle system with console UI
- [x] Basic save system

### 🎯 Milestone 1: The Initial Demo

**Goal:** Lay the foundation of the game. Focused on implementing core engine features, basic systems, and getting our workflow documented. The grand finale of this phase is a polished promotional video showcasing our progress to try and recruit volunteers to the team.

**Key Deliverables:**

* **Environments & Models:** Getting characters moving around Iwatodai Dorm, Paulownia Mall, and other environment models, with optimized models. Initial implementation of the initial move-in intro sequence.
* **User Interface:** Building out the foundational UI, including the top-corner calendar display, dialogue boxes with custom backgrounds, and a clean console-style battle menu. We are also laying the groundwork for FEMC palette swaps.
* **Under the Hood:** Setting up dummy zones for battle and dialogue testing, adding basic save data functionality, implementing asset streaming, and finalizing the PersonaUniversalToolchain.
