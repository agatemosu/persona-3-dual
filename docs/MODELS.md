## Import GMO Models into Blender
To import GMO models into Blender, you need to download the [Noesis Model Viewer](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91).

Open the GMO in Noesis. You should then see the model load in with textures and animations.

Now, export the GMO model as a .fbx file, with the ```-fbxmultitake``` advanced option. (this flag allows us to export the animations individually)

Once you have exported the .fbx, you are ready to import the model into Blender!


## Export Models from Blender
To export models from Blender, you need to install and use our custom Blender extension. This extension can be found in tools/plugins/blender & is called ```nds_model_exporter.py```.

To install a Blender plugin, go into ```Edit -> Preferences```.

Once you have installed the plugin, you must ensure that the plugin is **enabled** (checkmark).

The plugin is now installed! To actually export your model, simply go to ```File -> Export -> NDS Model (.zip)```. Note that exporting may take some time.
